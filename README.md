# Pandas-and-NumPy

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks showcasing concepts and techniques using **Pandas** and **NumPy**. It is organized into separate folders for each library, with detailed examples and explanations.


## Repository Structure



## **NumPy Concepts: **
- **Arithmetic Functions**: Perform arithmetic operations on arrays.
- **Indexing and Slicing**: Access specific elements, rows, columns, and slices.
- **Iterating through Arrays**: Understand array iteration, views, and copies.
- **Joining and Splitting Arrays**: Combine or split arrays based on requirements.
- **Array Reshaping**: Modify the structure and dimensions of arrays.
- **Advanced Operations**: Sorting, searching, inserting, and deleting elements.


## **Pandas Concepts: **
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing data and clean datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights from data using statistical and visualization techniques.
- **Data Filtering and Ordering**: Filter rows and sort data.
- **Grouping and Aggregation**: Summarize data by groups.
- **Indexing**: Work with indexes for faster and efficient data access.
- **Merge, Join, and Concatenate**: Combine multiple datasets.
- **Data Visualization**: Create insightful visualizations using Pandas' built-in capabilities.
- **File I/O**: Read and write data to/from various file formats.
